A, three time plots showing experimental data obtained by Varma and Palsson (5) as well as the corresponding simulations performed using FBA and rFBA. In the acetate plot, the regulatory/metabolic model predictions differ from that of the regulatory plot alone as shown. B, a table containing the parameters required to generate the time plots. C, in silico arrays showing the up- or down-regulation of selected genes or activity of regulatory proteins in the regulatory network (dark gray, gene transcription/protein activity; light gray, transcriptional repression/protein inactivity). Data from Oh and Liao (36) showing the experimentally determined transcriptional fold changes for certain genes (acetate: glucose) are shown where applicable. Note that the regulation of CRP is represented by a complex set of Boolean statements (see supplemental material). As a result, CRP activity is represented here as GLC or AC to denote when glucose or acetate is accepted by the system, respectively."
